  <title>Important Marine Mammal Areas</title>
  <abstract>The IUCN MMPATF IMMA is a joint project between the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) and World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA). The IUCN IMMA layer indicates discrete portions of habitat, important to marine mammal species that have the potential to be delineated and managed for conservation. IMMAs consist of areas that may merit place-based protection and/or monitoring. IMMAs can be seen as a marine mammal layer indicative of biodiversity and potentially ecosystem health for consideration by governments, intergovernmental organisations, conservation groups, and the general public. Information described include the name, location, marine mammal species of importance, the broad level and finer sub-divisions criteria used, and the area size of the IMMA. 

The IUCN IMMA layer has been created to be compatible with and inform the identification of other area-based management tools and conservation prioritisation areas and include but are not restricted to Ecologically or Biologically Significant Area (EBSA), Key Biodiversity Area (KBA), Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA), RAMSAR Convention Site (RAMSAR), Cetacean Critical Habitat (CCH), Biologically Important Area (BIA) and Important Shark and Ray Area (ISRA).  This dataset is drawn from knowledge provided directly to the IUCN MMPATF IMMA Secretariat by experts but may also include some data consolidated from 3rd party sources where other information may not have been available. These areas have been assessed by regional experts and were further assessed by a panel of independent reviewers. The IMMAs have been assessed by regional experts and were further assessed by a panel of indipendent reviewers. Each IMMA sub-region has been indipendently assessed acress separate regional expert identificaton workshops. Information on each sub-region is available on the IMMA website via www.marinemammalhabitat.org/immas/workshops/ Guidance on the use of selection criteria for the identification of IMMAs is available for download via https://www.marinemammalhabitat.org/downloads/

  <history>The IUCN MMPATF IMMA programme is a joint project between the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) and World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA). The IUCN IMMA layer indicates discrete portions of habitat, important to one or more marine mammal species that have the potential to be delineated and managed for conservation. IMMAs consist of areas that may merit place-based protection and/or monitoring. IMMAs can be seen as a marine mammal data layer indicative of important biodiversity and potentially ecosystem health that can be considered as priorities for protection and management by governments, intergovernmental organisations, conservation groups, and the general public.

Dataset ID:	iucn-imma
Temporal range: 	October 2016 – September 2023 
Geographical range: 	Global, Marine, Estuarine, Coastal Wetland, Shoreline, Intertidal 
Supplementary information:	The IUCN IMMA layer contains information, which describes discrete portions of habitat, important to marine mammal species that have the potential to be delineated and managed for conservation. Information described include the name, location, marine mammal species of importance, the broad level and finer sub-divisions of the criteria used, and the area size of the IMMA. 
Purpose of creation:	The IUCN IMMA layer has been created to provide decision makers with a spatial tool that identifies the most important habitats globally for marine mammal species. IMMAs consist of areas that may merit place-based protection and/or monitoring for consideration by governments, intergovernmental organisations, conservation groups, and the general public. The IMMA layer is complementary with other area-based management tools and conservation prioritisation areas and include but are not restricted to Ecologically or Biologically Significant Area (EBSA), Key Biodiversity Area (KBA), Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA), RAMSAR Convention Site (RAMSAR), Cetacean Critical Habitat (CCH), Biologically Important Area (BIA) and Important Shark and Ray Area (ISRA).
Creation methodology:	This dataset is drawn from knowledge provided directly to the IUCN MMPATF IMMA Secretariat by experts but may also include some data consolidated from 3rd party sources where other information may not have been available. The IMMAs have been assessed by regional experts and were further assessed by a panel of independent reviewers. Each IMMA sub-region has been independently assessed across separate regional expert identification workshops. Information on each sub-region is available on the IMMA website via https://www.marinemammalhabitat.org/immas/workshops/
		Guidance on the use of selection criteria for the identification of IMMAs is available for download via https://www.marinemammalhabitat.org/downloads/
Dataset ID: 		iucn-imma
E-mail: 		imma.shapefile@imma-network.org
Data lineage: 	The map shown in the metadata sheet is using the July 2023 IMMA release. The IMMA e-Atlas shows the same map and includes also additional layers (e.g., areas of interest - AoI, and candidate IMMAs - cIMMAs) not available for public download (https://www.marinemammalhabitat.org/imma-eatlas).
Category: 		IMMA
Keywords: 		Conservation, Marine, Mammals, Important, Biota, Oceans, Inland Waters 
Similar datasets: 	Ecological or Biological Significant Area (EBSA), Key Biodiversity Area (KBA), Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA), RAMSAR Convention Site (RAMSAR), Cetacean Critical Habitat (CCH), Biologically Important Area (BIA), Important Shark and Ray Areas (ISRA).
Limitations: 		The IUCN IMMA dataset is not necessarily a complete representation of all the important areas for marine mammals for a region; the quality of the IUCN IMMA depends on the accessibility of accurate, comprehensive, up-to-date expert information from data and knowledge holders and some areas with limited data that are nevertheless important may therefore not have been identified. Other regions not currently assessed within the IUCN IMMA programme will be addressed in future regional expert workshops. New information will be assessed on a decadal basis to determine new IMMAs in the region or re-examine existing IMMAs.
Maintenance frequency:	Data are updated on a 6-12 monthly basis
